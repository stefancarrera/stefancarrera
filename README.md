## :suspect: About Me
I'm a web developer with a passion for learning and making cool stuff! Speaking of cool stuff, check out some of the things I've built while you're here: 

Like the [D&D Directory](https://stefancarrera.github.io/dnd-directory/); where you can look up spell information or roll some D20s! 

Or if you want to doodle something, check out [5 by 5 Sketch]( https://five-by-five-sketch.herokuapp.com/); an in browser drawing app! 

I constantly strive to strengthen the skills I already have, while looking to gain more to add to my deck.
